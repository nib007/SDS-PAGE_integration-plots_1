In this repository are a python code where you paste in Band %, Lane % of a protein detected with total protein stain e.g. commassie, silver. The results can be many lane results integrated in for example Image Lab at different pH, salt and a additive e.g. Urea. Program then computes plots of the combined effect as the three variables (if any).

Summary: Python code where you paste in Band %, Lane % of a protein detected, plots of the combined effect as the three variable
